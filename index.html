      <p class = "review"> The New York Times: "Guillermo del Toro’s latest film is an unlikely and lyrical love story, inspired by 'Creature From the Black Lagoon.'" </p>
      <p class = "review"> Vulture: "It’s an utterly lovely, complacent movie, too comfortable with itself to generate real dramatic tension." </p>
      <p class = "review"> Washington Post: "Elisa, it turns out, is mute, making her more highly attuned to what?s being communicated under the dank, vaguely sinister surface at the aquarium." </p>
